**AVIATE** stands for  ***Autonomous Visual Interpreter for Audiovisual Technicians Everywhere***

It is a full-stack system that lets users upload audiovisual (AV) construction plan sets (PDFs/images) and uses OCR + GPT-based logic to interpret routing, devices, control paths, and more â€” outputting structured signal flow and system summaries.
This is a test environment. Larger plan sets may be slow or hang and fail, so please be gentle. 

**Note:** I am not a developer. This is a learning exercise as much it is a hopefully useful tool for my friends, coworkers and fellow AV professionals. 
I apologize for any bugginess or crashing. If this project seems worthwhile continuing more compute will be added in the future.
